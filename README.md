## 🔄 Relationship to Original Implementation

This implementation was developed independently based on the research paper ["A-Mem: Agentic Memory for LLM Agents"](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.12110v11). The original authors' production-ready system ([A-mem-sys](https://github.com/WujiangXu/A-mem-sys)) was discovered after this implementation was completed.

**Key Differences:**

This implementation focuses on **MCP Server integration** for IDE environments (Cursor, VSCode), providing:
- Direct IDE integration via MCP protocol
- **Explicit graph-based memory linking** using NetworkX (DiGraph) with typed edges, reasoning, and weights
- File import with automatic chunking
- Memory reset and management tools
- Modern TUI benchmarking tool for Ollama model speed testing

The original [A-mem-sys](https://github.com/WujiangXu/A-mem-sys) repository provides a **pip-installable Python library** with:
- Multiple LLM backend support (OpenAI, Ollama, OpenRouter, SGLang)
- Library-based integration for Python applications
- Comprehensive API for programmatic usage
- **Implicit linking** via ChromaDB embeddings (no explicit graph structure)

**Technical Architecture Difference:**

- **This implementation**: Dual-storage architecture
  - ChromaDB for vector similarity search
  - NetworkX DiGraph for explicit typed relationships (with `relation_type`, `reasoning`, `weight`)
  - Graph traversal for finding directly connected memories
  - Enables complex queries like "find all memories related to X through type Y"

- **Original implementation**: Single-storage architecture
  - ChromaDB as primary storage
  - Implicit linking through embedding similarity
  - Simpler architecture, less overhead

Both implementations are valid approaches to the same research paper, serving different use cases and integration scenarios.

## 🏗️ Framework

The framework of our Agentic Memory system showing the dynamic interaction between LLM agents and memory components, extended with our MCP Server integration and dual-storage architecture:

*The framework diagram illustrates the core memory system workflow: Note Construction (left), Memory Processing with MCP Server Integration (center), and Memory Retrieval (right). Our implementation extends the original framework with direct IDE integration via MCP protocol, explicit graph-based memory linking using NetworkX DiGraph with typed edges (relation_type, reasoning, weight), file import with automatic chunking, and a dual-storage architecture using ChromaDB for vector similarity search and NetworkX for explicit typed relationships.*

## 🆕 New Features Overview

### Type Classification
Every note is automatically classified into one of 6 types:
- **rule**: Imperative instructions ("Never X", "Always Y")
- **procedure**: Numbered steps or sequential instructions
- **concept**: Explanations of concepts, no commands
- **tool**: Describes functions, APIs, or utilities
- **reference**: Tables, comparison lists, cheatsheets
- **integration**: Describes connections between systems

### Priority Scoring
Search results are ranked using on-the-fly priority calculation:
- **Type Weight**: Rules and procedures have higher priority
- **Age Factor**: Newer notes have higher priority
- **Usage Count**: Frequently accessed notes get boosted
- **Edge Count**: Well-connected notes are prioritized

### Event Logging
All critical operations are logged to `data/events.jsonl`:
- `NOTE_CREATED`: When a new note is created
- `RELATION_CREATED`: When two notes are linked
- `MEMORY_EVOLVED`: When an existing note is updated
- `LINKS_PRUNED`: When old/weak links are removed
- `RELATIONS_SUGGESTED`: When new connections are found
- `ENZYME_SCHEDULER_RUN`: When automatic maintenance runs

### Memory Enzymes
Autonomous background processes that maintain graph health:
- **Link Pruner**: Removes edges older than 90 days or with weight < 0.3
- **Relation Suggester**: Finds semantically similar notes (cosine similarity ≥ 0.75)
- **Summary Digester**: Compresses nodes with >8 children into compact summaries

### Automatic Scheduler
The system automatically runs memory enzymes every hour:
- Runs in background without blocking MCP operations
- Logs all maintenance activities
- Gracefully handles errors and continues running

### IDE Integration

#### Cursor IDE

1. Open the MCP configuration file:
   - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json` (or `C:\Users\<username>\.cursor\mcp.json`)
   - macOS: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
   - Linux: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

2. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "a-mem": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "src.a_mem.main"
      ],
      "cwd": "/path/to/a-mem-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Adjust `cwd` to the absolute path to your project directory!

3. Restart Cursor to load the configuration.

#### Visual Studio Code (with MCP Extension)

1. Install the MCP Extension for VSCode (if available)

2. Open VSCode Settings (JSON):
   - `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS)
   - Type "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"

3. Add the MCP Server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "a-mem": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "src.a_mem.main"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/a-mem-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

**Alternative:** Use the `mcp.json` file in the project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "a-mem": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "src.a_mem.main"],
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Usage in IDE

After configuration, the MCP tools are directly available in your IDE:

- **Chat/Composer**: Use the tools via natural language
  - "Store this information: ..."
  - "Search for memories about: ..."
  - "Show me the memory statistics"

- **Code**: The tools are automatically available as functions

See `MCP_SERVER_SETUP.md` for detailed information about all available tools.

### Event Log

All system events are automatically logged to `data/events.jsonl` in JSONL format (one JSON object per line). This provides a complete audit trail of:
- Note creation and updates
- Relation creation and removal
- Memory evolution events
- Enzyme maintenance runs
- Scheduler activities

You can view the event log with:
```bash
# View last 10 events
tail -n 10 data/events.jsonl

# View all events
cat data/events.jsonl | jq .
```
